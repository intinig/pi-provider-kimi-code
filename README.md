**Reuse your [Kimi Code Plan](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/) inside [pi-coding-agent](https://pi.dev/)** — no separate API credits, no second billing dashboard. Every request draws from your Kimi Code membership quota (the 5-hour token bucket) instead of billing per-token on the Moonshot Open Platform.

It's **"Claude Code for Kimi"** — log in with your Kimi account, with `KIMI_API_KEY` still supported as a fallback for CI. You get `kimi-for-coding` (the Kimi-k2.6 latest alias, backed by the same Kimi Code Plan that covers K2.6 and K2.5) with a 262K-token context window, automatic prompt caching, automatic large-image upload, and compatibility with both Anthropic-style and OpenAI-style clients.

## Why not the built-in `kimi-coding` provider?

pi-coding-agent already ships a built-in `kimi-coding` provider (see [`pi.dev/docs/.../providers`](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/providers)). It works, but it's a thin generic Anthropic-protocol binding to `api.kimi.com/coding`. Three concrete things you lose by using it:

- **Browser-based account login + `kimi-cli` session reuse.** The built-in provider authenticates via `KIMI_API_KEY` only. This extension adds the OAuth device-code flow and transparently picks up an existing `kimi-cli` session from `~/.kimi/credentials/kimi-code.json`, so your Kimi Code Plan login carries over from the official CLI.
- **Images and videos are inlined as base64.** The built-in provider has no integration with Kimi's `/files` upload endpoint, so multimedia is sent inline as base64 in `messages`, counted toward your token budget and capped by request-size limits. This extension uploads images over `KIMI_CODE_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (default 1 MB) and all videos to `/files`, references them by `ms://` id, and pays only the file-storage cost instead of token cost.
- **OpenAI-compatible mode of the Coding endpoint is not exposed.** The built-in `kimi-coding` provider is Anthropic-only on `api.kimi.com/coding`. Kimi For Coding also serves an OpenAI-compatible variant at `api.kimi.com/coding/v1` — useful when something in your toolchain expects `role: "tool"` semantics, or when working around the [tool_result misread issue](https://github.com/Leechael/pi-provider-kimi-code/issues/5) under the Anthropic protocol. Opt in with `KIMI_CODE_PROTOCOL=openai`. (Note: the `moonshotai` / `moonshotai-cn` providers in `pi` are a different product — Moonshot's pay-per-token Open Platform, not the Coding Plan.)

> On prompt caching: the built-in provider works fine. Kimi's Coding endpoint caches by content prefix hash automatically — neither `cache_control` markers nor `prompt_cache_key` actually drive cache hits. See [docs/caching.md](docs/caching.md) for measurements.

## Who is this for?

- You already pay for a **[Kimi Code Plan](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/)** and want to use it inside `pi-coding-agent` instead of the official `kimi-cli` — see [MoonshotAI/kimi-cli#757](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/issues/757) for the canonical feature request this extension answers.
- You want **"Claude Code for Kimi"**: log in with your Kimi account instead of buying separate API credits. (`KIMI_API_KEY` is also supported as a fallback for CI.)
- You're in the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) ecosystem and want **Kimi K2.6** (and the K2.5 coverage that comes with the Code Plan) as a pi provider.

Pay-per-token via `KIMI_API_KEY` also works if you just want to try Kimi in CI or without a subscription.

## Features

- **Browser login with your Kimi account** — reuse your Kimi Code Membership without buying separate API credits. Credentials are stored locally and refreshed automatically. `KIMI_API_KEY` is also accepted for pay-per-token or CI use.
- **Reuses an existing `kimi-cli` session** — if you already signed in with the official `kimi-cli`, the extension picks up the token from `~/.kimi/credentials/kimi-code.json` and skips the device-code dance entirely.
- **Live model metadata** — name, context window, and reasoning / image-input capabilities are refreshed from Kimi's `/v1/models` endpoint at every login / refresh, so server-side rollouts (e.g. expanded context) take effect without a provider release.
- **262K-token context window** on the registered model (overridable; see [`docs/ENV.md`](docs/ENV.md)).
- **Automatic prompt caching** — Kimi's Coding endpoint caches by content prefix hash with TTL ≥ 5 minutes (the extension does not have to do anything to make it work). `prompt_cache_key` is still injected for parity with upstream `kimi-cli` but has no measurable effect on cache hits. See [docs/caching.md](docs/caching.md) for the empirical breakdown.
- **Automatic large-image upload** — images over 1 MB are uploaded to Kimi's `/v1/files` endpoint and referenced by `ms://` id, so you don't hit inline payload limits.
- **Works with both Anthropic- and OpenAI-compatible modes** — use whichever one your pi setup expects.
- **Stream cleaning** — Kimi occasionally leaks placeholder blocks into the stream during thinking phases; this extension catches and hides them so your pi UI stays clean.
- **Zero dependencies, zero build step** — the extension loads directly as TypeScript, nothing to compile.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-kimi-code
```

Or load a local checkout without installing:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-provider-kimi-code
```

### Install from GitHub Release tarball

If you prefer not to use npm, download the tarball from the [latest release](https://github.com/Leechael/pi-provider-kimi-code/releases/latest), extract it, and install from the local path:

```bash
# Download and extract
curl -L https://github.com/Leechael/pi-provider-kimi-code/releases/latest/download/pi-provider-kimi-code.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp

# Install from the extracted directory
pi install /tmp/pi-provider-kimi-code
```

## Authentication

### Browser login (recommended)

Inside `pi`, run:

```
/login kimi-coding
```

A browser tab opens, you sign into your Kimi account, and credentials are stored at `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`. Tokens refresh automatically.

### Already logged in via `kimi-cli`?

If `~/.kimi/credentials/kimi-code.json` exists (i.e. you previously signed in with the official `kimi-cli`), `/login kimi-coding` reads that file, refreshes the access token if needed, and finishes without opening a browser. The kimi-cli credential file is read-only from this extension's perspective — it is never overwritten. Set `KIMI_SHARE_DIR` to point at a non-default location.

### API key

For CI or pay-per-token use, set `KIMI_API_KEY`:

```bash
KIMI_API_KEY=sk-... pi
```

## Models

| ID                | Name            | Reasoning | Input       | Context | Max Output |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `kimi-for-coding` | Kimi for Coding | yes       | text, image | 262 144 | 32 000     |

`kimi-for-coding` is the latest alias on the Kimi Code Plan — today it points at Kimi-k2.6. The Plan itself still covers K2.5; the upstream routes older model IDs to the current alias, but this provider only publishes the canonical `kimi-for-coding` entry.

Select it inside `pi`:

```
/model kimi-coding/kimi-for-coding
```

| `KIMI_CODE_DEBUG`                  | Set to `1` to print provider-side debug logs           |

Full list — including `kimi-cli`-compatible aliases (`KIMI_BASE_URL`, `KIMI_SHARE_DIR`) and model-override knobs (`KIMI_MODEL_NAME`, `KIMI_MODEL_CAPABILITIES`, `KIMI_MODEL_THINKING_KEEP`, ...) — lives in [docs/ENV.md](docs/ENV.md).

## FAQ

### How is this different from the official `kimi-cli`?

`kimi-cli` is Moonshot's own terminal agent. It's a full CLI — it replaces pi, you can't use it as a pi provider. This extension is the bridge: it lets you keep pi as your harness and point it at your Kimi Code Membership for inference, reusing the same login flow `kimi-cli` v1.3+ ships.

### Do I need a paid Kimi subscription?

For browser login, yes — whatever your Moonshot account is entitled to is what the provider can access. Without a plan you'll hit rate limits quickly. For pay-per-token usage, set `KIMI_API_KEY` instead.

### Where does my data go?

Requests go only to `api.kimi.com` (Moonshot's servers). Login credentials are stored locally at `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, readable only by your user. Nothing is uploaded to any third party.

### Is this affiliated with Moonshot AI?

No. This is an independent extension. The login flow is derived from the public implementation in the open-source [`kimi-cli`](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli) repository.

### Which pi version does this work with?

Any recent [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent).

### Why are there two protocol modes?

Kimi's coding endpoint speaks both Anthropic and OpenAI dialects. Anthropic mode has better visibility into cache hits, so it's the default. Switch via `KIMI_CODE_PROTOCOL=openai` if something in your pi setup prefers the OpenAI path.

## Troubleshooting

### `pi` reports `fetch failed` even though `curl` works

pi runs on Node's `fetch` / undici stack, which handles `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `all_proxy` differently from `curl`. Verify those variables in the pi process's environment. The bundled smoke-test script `scripts/test_e2e.sh` prints the effective proxy-related environment for easier debugging.

### `/login kimi-coding` prints a device code but the browser never opens

The login flow always prints a verification URL — opening it is the terminal's job. If your terminal or OS blocks auto-open, copy the URL and paste it into a browser manually.

### "Access denied" or subscription errors after a successful login

Your Moonshot account needs an active Kimi Code subscription for the provider to do anything useful. If the same account works in `kimi-cli`, re-run `/login kimi-coding` to refresh credentials.

### Large images fail with a payload error

This extension uploads images over `KIMI_CODE_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (default 1 MB) to Kimi's Files API and references them as `ms://`. Videos always upload. Set `KIMI_CODE_DEBUG=1` to see upload decisions in the provider logs.

### Prompt cache never seems to hit

Kimi's cache is **content-based**: it fires automatically when your prompt prefix matches an earlier request, independent of any explicit cache key. If `cache_read_input_tokens` (Anthropic) or `cached_tokens` (OpenAI) stays at `0` across calls, something in the prompt is varying between turns. The usual suspects:

- On the Anthropic-compat endpoint, the `system` prompt or the `tools` array changed (e.g. an MCP plugin loaded mid-session). Either fully invalidates the cache — see [docs/caching.md](docs/caching.md), Finding 11. OpenAI-compat endpoint not yet measured for this scenario.
- An `image_url` reference (`ms://<file_id>`) changed between turns. Same rule — see Finding 17.
- You're comparing across two cold `pi` invocations, not within a single session. Cache benefits accrue **within** a session; pi's system/tools assembly drifts between sessions. See Finding 18.
- A timestamp, request ID, or randomized header is being interpolated into the prompt.
- The first ~256 tokens of the prompt differ between turns.

`PI_CACHE_RETENTION=none` skips `prompt_cache_key` injection but **does not** disable Kimi's caching (the cache is unconditional). For deterministic measurement, run `scripts/test_e2e.sh` with `KIMI_E2E_ONLY_CACHE=1`. See [docs/caching.md](docs/caching.md) for full mechanics.

### OpenAI-compatible tools complain about a `developer` role

In OpenAI mode this extension maps the `developer` role to `system` (Kimi's Coding endpoint does not recognize `developer`). If something in your toolchain expects `developer` to round-trip, use Anthropic mode instead.
